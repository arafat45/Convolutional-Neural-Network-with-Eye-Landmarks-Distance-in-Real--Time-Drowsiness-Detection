# Convolutional-Neural-Network-with-Eye-Landmarks-Distance-in-Real-Time-Drowsiness-Detection

In this project we introduced a CNN architecture using least numbers of feature maps and layers which can predict the eye state of a person in Real Time. From the Duration of an Eye Blink and Eye blink pattern we determined the drowsy state of a person. We trained different famous CNN networks with the same dataset and compared our results. For doing the project following materials were used:

** Language: Python 3

** Libraries: 1. Standard Python Libraries like numpy, matplotlib etc.
              2. Keras Libraries with TensorFlow backend
              3. Sci kit learn libraries
              4. OpenCV
              
** Hardware:  1. PC having 8 Gb RAM, Core i7 and 7th Genration processor
              2. Webcam for capturing Real Time Videos
